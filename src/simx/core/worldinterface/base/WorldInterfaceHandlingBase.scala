   * this one is a bit advanced, so here is what happens:
   * the function takes two parameters, one function that instanciates the message to be send and the handler which
   * shall be executed when an answer to that message is sent.
   * Initially an ID is generated and stored to identify the message which is sent. Then a single-use-handler is
   * installed, which uses that generated id. The installed handler simply calls the function "handler" which is
   * provided as a parameter, applying the value returned by the worldInterfaceActor.
   * Finally a message is sent to the worldInterfaceActor, which contains an handler (executed by the
   * worldInterfaceActor), that sends the id, value tuple back, causing the invocation of the installed handler
